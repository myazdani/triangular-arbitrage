## Customization Options

### 1. Modify Trading Parameters

Edit the `PaperTradingBot` initialization in `paper_trading_main.py`:

```python
# Conservative settings
paper_exchange = PaperExchange(
    initial_balances={'USDT': 1000.0},  # Start with $1,000
    trading_fee=0.001,                  # 0.1% fee
    max_slippage=0.001                  # 0.1% slippage
)

# Aggressive settings
paper_exchange = PaperExchange(
    initial_balances={'USDT': 50000.0}, # Start with $50,000
    trading_fee=0.0005,                 # 0.05% fee (VIP rates)
    max_slippage=0.005                  # 0.5% slippage (high volatility)
)
```

### 2. Change Session Duration

```python
# Run for different durations
await bot.run_session(duration_minutes=30, scan_interval=15)  # 30 min, scan every 15s
await bot.run_session(duration_minutes=120, scan_interval=60) # 2 hours, scan every 1 min
```

### 3. Try Different Exchanges

```python
# Test different exchanges
bot = PaperTradingBot(exchange_name="binance")
bot = PaperTradingBot(exchange_name="coinbase")
bot = PaperTradingBot(exchange_name="kraken")
```

### 4. Test Different Profit Thresholds

In `paper_trading_main.py`, modify the profit threshold:

```python
# More conservative - require 1% minimum profit
if opportunities and profit_rate > 1.01:  # 1% minimum

# More aggressive - accept 0.2% profit
if opportunities and profit_rate > 1.002:  # 0.2% minimum
```

## Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Success Rate**: Should be >60% for viable strategy
2. **Net Profit/Loss**: Total profit minus fees
3. **Average Profit per Trade**: Must exceed average fees
4. **Execution Time**: Faster is better (arbitrage is time-sensitive)

### What Success Looks Like

```
‚úÖ Good Results:
- Success Rate: 70-80%
- Net Profit: Positive after fees
- Average Profit: $5-20 per trade
- Execution Time: <2 seconds

‚ùå Poor Results:
- Success Rate: <50%
- Net Profit: Negative after fees
- Average Profit: <$1 per trade
- Execution Time: >5 seconds
```

## Common Scenarios

### 1. No Opportunities Found

```
2024-12-01 14:30:22 - No profitable opportunities found
```

**This is normal!** Arbitrage opportunities are rare. Try:
- Lower the profit threshold
- Increase scan frequency
- Try different exchanges
- Run during high-volatility periods

### 2. All Trades Failing

```
‚ùå Arbitrage failed: Insufficient balance
```

**Solutions:**
- Check your initial balance
- Reduce position size
- Verify symbol availability on exchange

### 3. Low Profitability

```
Net Profit/Loss: -$15.23
```

**This happens when:**
- Fees exceed profits
- High slippage
- Slow execution

**Solutions:**
- Increase minimum profit threshold
- Reduce slippage tolerance
- Use exchanges with lower fees

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

```python
# Begin with small amounts
initial_balances={'USDT': 1000.0}
```

### 2. Monitor Different Market Conditions

- **Bull Market**: Higher volatility, more opportunities
- **Bear Market**: Lower volatility, fewer opportunities
- **High Volume Times**: Better liquidity, less slippage
- **Low Volume Times**: Higher slippage, more failures

### 3. Keep Records

```python
# Save all your sessions
session_files = [
    'paper_trading_results_20241201_143022.json',
    'paper_trading_results_20241201_150022.json',
    'paper_trading_results_20241201_160022.json'
]

# Analyze trends over time
for file in session_files:
    analyzer = TradingAnalyzer(file)
    analyzer.generate_performance_report()
```

### 4. Test Edge Cases

```python
# Test with minimal balance
initial_balances={'USDT': 100.0}

# Test with high fees
trading_fee=0.005  # 0.5% fee

# Test with high slippage
max_slippage=0.01  # 1% slippage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run multiple sessions** with different parameters
2. **Analyze patterns** in your results
3. **Optimize settings** based on findings
4. **Consider real trading** only after consistent paper profits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /path/to/triangular-arbitrage
python paper_trading_main.py
```

**2. Network Issues**
```
Failed to get current price for BTC/USDT
```
- Check internet connection
- Try different exchange
- Restart the session

**3. No Opportunities**
```
No profitable opportunities found
```
- Lower profit threshold
- Try different time of day
- Check exchange is operational

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the log output for error messages
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Try running the original detector: `python main.py`
4. Check exchange status online

## Remember

- **Paper trading is risk-free** - experiment freely!
- **Real arbitrage is much harder** - this is educational
- **Fees matter** - they can eliminate theoretical profits
- **Speed is crucial** - opportunities disappear quickly

Start with the default settings and gradually customize based on your findings. Happy paper trading! üéØ
